//here in this application i made a password generator, 

I set global Variables at the top including all of the character sets possible for a password. 

Then I set up a fucntion to obtain user data in order to meet a specific criteria for password needs. 

I took in all the user data to make a final array of what characters were to be used and how long the password needed to be. 

The new password was the generated and displayed on the html.
